## Description

Mathid (math+kid) is a fun and engaging math game app built spefically for my kids. It combines learning and play to help them develop their math skills in an interactive and enjoyable way. The game is tailored to their age or knowledge level, making it both challenging and educational. My goal is to create something they genuinely enjoy while fostering a love for math.
